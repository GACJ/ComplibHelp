# Extended search
A quick search allows you to search the method, composition and collections libraries by title. An advanced search allows you to specify a large number of filters in order to find methods and compositions with specified properties. 

However, neither method is able to test compositions and methods against each other. This requires an **extended search**.

!!! note
    The ability to perform extended searches is restricted to **Power Users**.
